This repository holds open source SymbolSource projects.

## SymbolSource.Server.Basic

Forked the dariuszzamorski fork and updated 'stable' branch.  Uploaded to Nuget Gallery as [Vusion.SymbolSource.Server.Basic](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vusion.SymbolSource.Server.Basic), ready to install into an empty MVC 3 project.

The Gateway and Server.Basic projects hold the implementation of a symbol and source server equivalent to NuGet.Server. A simple, zeroconf solution for everyone to use. 

### Installing

You can read more about Server.Basic in these blog posts, which also include instructions on how to set it up:

 3. Run SymbolSOurce.Server.Basic.Host or nuget pack SymbolSource.Server.Basic.nuspec and install as exaplained above.
 
## SymbolSource.Integration.NuGet.PackageExplorer
This is the NuGet Package Explorer plugin for validating symbol packages

## SymbolSource.Integration.NuGet.CommandLine
This could one day integrate symbol package validation into nuget.exe, but is only a stub at the moment.

## SymbolSource.Processing.Uninternalizer
This is a fun C# source code converter that uses NRefactory to change all protected and internal members into public ones. We use it to publish SymbolSource.Microsoft.Cci.Metadata.
